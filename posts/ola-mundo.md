Hi, my name [Érick Kenji Sugahara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A9rick-kenji-sugahara-4725737a/), in previous link you will see my skills and another things related to my works. But in resume, i'm a **full stack developer** specialized in web front-end development with React JS.

Along my journey, i learn a lot of things and various programing language but my love is build web apps to be useful to another people. The best sensation is see the client using and loving your solution.
